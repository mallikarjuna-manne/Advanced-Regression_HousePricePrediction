## General Information
- A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. 
- The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. 
- For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. 
- The data is provided in the CSV file(train.csv).
- The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. 
- The goal is to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.
- The company wants to know which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and how well those variables describe the price of a house.
 

Also, determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.

## Conclusions
- Price of house with Excellet basement quality is highest among all
- Price of house with Excellent Kitchen quality is also higher.
- Price of house that is having Poured Contrete Foundation is highest.
- The Mean square error in case of Ridge is 0.1538 and in case of Lasso regression Mean square error
is 0.1544. The MSE of both models is almost same.
- Lasso model has more near zero coefficients.
